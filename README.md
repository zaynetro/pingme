# PingME

Get notifications easily when someone needs you.

Create your personal room, share your room link and receive notifications, when people are trying to reach you (open link). Remember to leave your tab open (Could be changed soon with Service Workers) and allow notifications.

**WHY?** The only reason for this repo is my will to learn GO for writing server-side applications.

## Future plans

* Implement queue, so you receive only a summary of all requests (no need to send dozens of notifications)
* Review backend
* Add refer to url, so you can see where users came from

**NOTE:** Plans might change depending on free time and interest.
